In no way am I passing these textures off as my own.

This is basically a Deo's 2k Pack revamp + some outline theme inspired by Wyncraft and a bunch of other textures from other packs.
These are the various packs and artists who I took textures and generally inspiration from:

If there are any texturepacks or people that I have not credited... I'm sorry.
Though I do believe the associations above cover all the bases...
Msg me otherwise if you believe a texture deserves to be credited to another owner

The textures that i have actually made are:

- All The Tools
- Roast & Raw Chicken
- Firework Rocket Texture
- Models for Diamond, Gold & Iron Armour
- Seeds
- Cauldron Iteem Texture

The rest are either adapted from other texturepacks or exact from various texturepacks (or i have forgotten that i have edited the textures)
